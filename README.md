# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** I built using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s the classic game we all played on paper, but now in the browser.  
You can play it with a friend on the same device — Player **X** vs Player **O**.

## ✨ Features
- Playable in the browser (no installs needed)
- Two-player mode (X and O take turns)

- Shows result (Winner / Draw)
- Restart button to reset the game
